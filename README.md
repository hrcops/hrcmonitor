### HRCMonitor

This code will run either on `han-v@cfa.haarvard.edu`

__This code must be run in a Ska Environment!__


It talks to both `maude` (for real-time telemetry) and the `ska/cheta` arvhive (for long-term monitoring).

I do this on `han-v` by first

`source /proj/sot/ska3/flight/bin/ska_envs.sh`
then,

`python hrcmonitor.py`
